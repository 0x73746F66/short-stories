# The Sorting of Severus Snape

*A Tale from the Marauders' Era*

---

## September 1st, 1971 — The Beginning

The Great Hall was more magnificent than anything Severus Snape had ever imagined in his wildest dreams. Four long tables stretched before him like rivers of polished oak, illuminated by thousands upon thousands of floating candles that hovered weightlessly beneath a ceiling enchanted to mirror the night sky above Scotland. Stars twinkled overhead with impossible clarity, and the faces of hundreds of students turned toward the nervous first-years standing clustered at the entrance.

Severus clutched his wand hand inside his pocket, his knuckles white with tension. His coat, handed down from some distant relative whose name he'd never learned, hung awkwardly on his thin frame like borrowed robes. His hair, which his mother had tried desperately to tame that morning with water and steely determination, had already fallen lank around his sallow face. But none of that mattered now. He was here. He was finally, impossibly, wonderfully here at Hogwarts.

## The Long Walk

*"When I call your name, you will come forward and sit on the stool,"* Professor McGonagall announced, her voice crisp and commanding, cutting through the nervous chatter. She held an ancient, patched wizard's hat in her hands—the legendary Sorting Hat, the very one Lily had told him about during their excited conversations in the sun-drenched weeks before term began.

Lily. He glanced sideways and found her easily in the crowd of first-years, her presence a beacon of familiarity. Her red hair seemed to glow in the candlelight like phoenix fire, and her green eyes were wide with childlike wonder as she took in the magical ceiling above. She caught his eye and gave him a nervous smile, sharing their private excitement. He tried to smile back, but his face felt frozen, paralyzed by anticipation.

Names were called. *"Abbott, Marcus!"* A nervous boy scurried forward like a frightened mouse. The hat was placed on his head, and after a moment of consideration: *"HUFFLEPUFF!"* The table on the right erupted in enthusiastic applause.

More names followed in alphabetical procession. *"Black, Sirius!"* A handsome boy with long dark hair swaggered forward, confidence and pure-blood arrogance radiating from every measured step. Severus recognized him—a Black, from one of the oldest and most noble pure-blood families in Britain. The hat barely touched his head before shouting, *"GRYFFINDOR!"* The boy's aristocratic face fell for just a fraction of a moment before he masked it with a practiced grin and headed to the Gryffindor table, where students were cheering—perhaps a bit too enthusiastically, Severus thought darkly.

## The Call

*"Evans, Lily!"*

Severus's heart clenched painfully in his chest. Lily walked forward, her head held high despite the slight tremor visible in her hands. The hat settled gently on her brilliant red hair, and Severus found himself holding his breath, bargaining with forces unseen. He knew what he wanted—needed—to hear with desperate urgency. They had to be in the same house. They had to be together. This was their chance to be equals, to learn magic side by side, to—

*"GRYFFINDOR!"*

The word rang through the hall like a ceremonial bell. Lily's face lit up with a radiant smile as she hurried to the Gryffindor table, where that Black boy was already making room for her with exaggerated gallantry. Severus felt something cold and heavy settle in his stomach like a stone, but he pushed it away with practiced discipline. It didn't matter which house she was in. They would still be friends. They would still—

*"Lupin, Remus!"*

Another boy, this one looking rather shabby and perpetually tired, stepped forward with visible anxiety. *"GRYFFINDOR!"* Of course it was.

*"Pettigrew, Peter!"*

A short, plump boy who looked like he might faint from sheer nerves. The hat deliberated longer this time, humming thoughtfully, but eventually: *"GRYFFINDOR!"*

*"Potter, James!"*

A boy with impossibly messy black hair and round glasses bounded forward with infectious enthusiasm and easy confidence. He didn't even look nervous. The hat barely had time to settle on his head before—*"GRYFFINDOR!"* The boy practically flew to the table, where Black grabbed him in a celebratory embrace as if they'd been brothers for years, not mere minutes.

Severus's jaw tightened involuntarily. The Gryffindor table was getting crowded with people who looked like they belonged in heroic storybooks—champions and legends in training. And Lily was sitting there among them, laughing at something one of them said, already belonging.

## His Turn

*"Snape, Severus!"*

The moment he'd been simultaneously anticipating and dreading with equal intensity. Severus forced his reluctant feet to move, one in front of the other. The walk to the stool felt like miles across an endless battlefield. He could feel hundreds of eyes boring into him—judging his shabby coat, his lank greasy hair, his too-large nose that dominated his sallow face. He heard a barely-suppressed snicker from somewhere behind him. His face burned with shame, but he kept his expression carefully blank as he'd learned to do at home when his father was in one of his violent moods.

He sat on the three-legged stool, and Professor McGonagall lowered the ancient hat onto his head. It fell over his eyes like a curtain, blocking out the Great Hall, the watching students, everything. For a long moment, there was only darkness and his own ragged breathing.

Then a voice spoke directly into his mind, dry and thoughtful and impossibly old: *"Ah, another difficult one. So much here, so much... pain, yes, but also burning ambition. Sharp mind, very sharp indeed. Thirst for knowledge, hunger for recognition... and love, yes, deep and desperate love for that Muggle-born girl."*

Severus's breath caught in his throat. The hat could see everything—every hope, every fear, every secret wish he'd never dared speak aloud.

*"You could be great in Gryffindor,"* the hat mused philosophically. *"Brave enough, in your own way. You walked away from your father's drunken anger every day with your chin up. That takes a particular kind of courage, boy."*

Gryffindor. He could be with Lily. They could learn together, grow together, become powerful wizards together—

*"But is that what you truly need?"* the hat interrupted his desperate thoughts. *"Or is it merely what you want? There's a profound difference, you know. Gryffindor would throw you among lions who would see your differences before your potential. Among them, you would always be the outsider looking in, forever proving yourself, fighting every day to be seen as worthy."*

The hat paused meaningfully, and Severus felt it delving deeper into his mind, sifting through precious memories—his mother teaching him his first spell in secret, the countless hours he'd spent in the library reading his mother's worn textbooks by candlelight, the profound satisfaction of finally mastering a difficult potion after weeks of failure, the triumphant moment he'd created his first original spell modification at age ten.

*"Ah, there it is. SLYTHERIN!"*

The final word boomed through the Great Hall like thunder. Severus felt the hat being lifted from his head, returning him to the overwhelming reality of the moment. The Slytherin table was applauding—not as enthusiastically as some of the other houses had cheered for their new members, but with a measured, sophisticated approval. He stood on shaky legs and walked to the table on the left, carefully avoiding looking at the Gryffindor table. He didn't want to see Lily's reaction, didn't want to know if disappointment clouded her features.

## A New Path

As Severus took his seat among the green and silver, a tall boy with platinum blond hair and aristocratic features extended a pale hand. *"Lucius Malfoy, sixth year. Welcome to Slytherin, young Snape. That's quite a reputation you bring with you."*

Severus blinked in genuine confusion. *"Reputation?"*

Lucius's smile was knowing, almost predatory. *"Word travels fast in our circles. They say you've been inventing spell modifications since before you even had a wand to cast them. That you know more about defensive magic than some fourth-years."* He leaned in conspiratorially, voice dropping. *"We value ambition and cunning here, yes, but we also value raw talent. And from what I hear, you have that in abundance."*

Something in Severus's chest loosened slightly, a knot unwinding. He glanced down the table at the other Slytherins—some pure-bloods with proud names, yes, but he also noticed a few who looked as shabby as he did, whose robes weren't quite new or properly fitted, who carried themselves with the same careful dignity he'd cultivated as armor.

*"Thank you,"* Severus managed, surprised to find he meant it sincerely.

The sorting continued its ceremonial procession, but Severus barely heard the names being called. His mind was churning with everything the hat had revealed. *You would always be the outsider looking in.* Was the hat right? Would Gryffindor have been a terrible mistake?

He finally allowed himself to glance at the Gryffindor table. Lily was watching him, and when their eyes met across the distance, she smiled—a genuine, warm smile—and gave him a little wave of reassurance. Relief flooded through him like a Patronus driving away darkness. She didn't care what house he was in. They would still be friends. Nothing had changed.

But then James Potter leaned over and whispered something to Sirius Black, both of them glancing in Severus's direction with cold assessment. They didn't smile. They didn't wave. Their expressions were coolly evaluating, already marking him as different, as other, as rival and potential enemy.

Severus turned away sharply, his jaw tight with suppressed anger. The hat had been right. In Gryffindor, he would have spent every single day proving himself to privileged boys like that, fighting desperately for scraps of recognition among the golden and the brave. Here, in Slytherin, perhaps he could simply be brilliant. Perhaps that would be enough.

## The Feast Begins

Dumbledore stood from the magnificent staff table, his long silver beard catching the candlelight like spun starlight. *"Welcome,"* he said, his voice somehow reaching every corner of the Great Hall without seeming to shout, *"welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!"*

Food appeared on the tables as if by miracle—more food than Severus had ever seen in his entire life. Golden roasted chicken with crispy skin, towering mountains of fluffy mashed potatoes, elaborate platters of roasted vegetables, crystal jugs of pumpkin juice, pies and puddings and pastries beyond counting. The other first-years dove in eagerly, but Severus took a moment, overwhelmed by the sheer abundance after years of sparse, meager meals at Spinner's End.

*"First time at a proper feast?"* a girl across from him asked perceptively. She had dark hair and keen, intelligent eyes that missed nothing. *"I'm Charity Burbage. Muggle-born,"* she added, and there was a hint of proud defiance in her voice, as if daring anyone to object.

*"Half-blood,"* Severus replied, serving himself a modest, careful portion of potatoes. *"Severus Snape."*

*"I know,"* Charity said matter-of-factly. *"I heard those Gryffindors talking about you already. Said you looked like you'd crawled out of a dungeon."* Her expression turned sympathetic and understanding. *"Idiots."*

Severus felt an unexpected kinship with this brave girl who'd been sorted into Slytherin despite—or perhaps because of—her Muggle birth. *"They don't matter,"* he said quietly, believing it for the first time.

*"No,"* Charity agreed firmly, raising her goblet. *"They don't. We'll show them what matters."* She raised her goblet of pumpkin juice high. *"To Slytherin. To ambition. To proving them all wrong."*

Severus clinked his goblet against hers, the sound ringing clear. *"To proving them wrong."*

## The First Night

Later, after the magnificent feast, after the prefects had led them down to the dungeons through winding corridors, after he'd seen the common room with its mysterious greenish light filtering through the lake water, after he'd claimed a bed in the first-year boys' dormitory—after all of that, Severus lay awake in the darkness, unable to sleep.

Through the window, he could see the murky green water of the Black Lake, and occasionally a dark shape would swim past—the tentacle of the Giant Squid, perhaps, or a school of silvery fish. The other boys in his dormitory were already snoring peacefully, exhausted by the overwhelming excitement of the day.

Severus pulled out his wand—eleven inches, yew, dragon heartstring core—and held it up reverently in the dim green light. His mother's last words to him before he'd boarded the Hogwarts Express echoed in his mind like a protective spell: *"Be brave, Severus. Be brilliant. And remember always, the house doesn't make the wizard—the wizard makes the house."*

He'd always assumed, with childlike certainty, that he'd be sorted into Gryffindor with Lily. He'd never seriously considered Slytherin, never imagined himself among the ambitious and cunning. But now that he was here, lying in this dungeon dormitory with its cold ancient stone walls and ambitious occupants, he felt something he hadn't expected at all: potential. Raw, unlimited potential.

The hat had seen it, Lucius Malfoy had acknowledged it, and even Charity Burbage had sensed it instinctively. Here, he wouldn't have to fight to be noticed or beg for recognition. Here, being clever and ambitious and different wasn't a shameful weakness—it was a valuable asset.

Tomorrow, classes would begin in earnest. Tomorrow, he would start learning real magic properly, not just from his mother's worn textbooks but from actual professors who were masters of their arts. Tomorrow, he would see Lily again, and together they would prove that ancient house rivalries didn't matter to true friends bound by deeper magic.

But tonight, Severus Snape lay in his new bed in the Slytherin dungeons and allowed himself to feel something he rarely permitted himself to feel: hope. Fragile, precious hope that perhaps the Sorting Hat had been right. Hope that perhaps he belonged here after all, among the ambitious and resourceful. Hope that perhaps, just perhaps, he could become the powerful wizard he'd always dreamed of being.

The last thing he thought before sleep finally claimed him was of the enchanted stars he'd seen on the ceiling of the Great Hall—countless points of light burning bright in the infinite darkness, each one refusing to be diminished by the surrounding night.

Just like him.
