# The Sorting of Severus Snape

## September 1st, 1971 - The Beginning

The Great Hall was more magnificent than anything Severus Snape had ever imagined. Four long tables stretched before him, illuminated by thousands of floating candles that hovered beneath a ceiling enchanted to mirror the night sky. Stars twinkled overhead, and the faces of hundreds of students turned toward the nervous first-years standing at the entrance.

Severus clutched his wand hand inside his pocket, his knuckles white. His coat, handed down from some distant relative, hung awkwardly on his thin frame. His hair, which his mother had tried desperately to tame that morning with water and determination, had already fallen lank around his sallow face. But none of that mattered now. He was here. He was finally at Hogwarts.

## The Long Walk

"When I call your name, you will come forward and sit on the stool," Professor McGonagall announced, her voice crisp and commanding. She held an ancient, patched wizard's hat in her hands—the Sorting Hat, the very one Lily had told him about during their excited conversations in the weeks before term began.

Lily. He glanced sideways and found her easily in the crowd of first-years. Her red hair seemed to glow in the candlelight, and her green eyes were wide with wonder as she took in the magical ceiling. She caught his eye and gave him a nervous smile. He tried to smile back, but his face felt frozen.

Names were called. "Abbott, Marcus!" A nervous boy scurried forward. The hat was placed on his head, and after a moment of consideration: "HUFFLEPUFF!" The table on the right erupted in applause.

More names followed. "Black, Sirius!" A handsome boy with long dark hair swaggered forward, confidence radiating from every step. Severus recognized him—a Black, from one of the oldest pure-blood families. The hat barely touched his head before shouting, "GRYFFINDOR!" The boy's face fell for just a moment before he masked it with a grin and headed to the Gryffindor table, where students were cheering—perhaps a bit too enthusiastically, Severus thought.

## The Call

"Evans, Lily!"

Severus's heart clenched. Lily walked forward, her head held high despite the slight tremor in her hands. The hat settled on her brilliant hair, and Severus found himself holding his breath. He knew what he wanted—needed—to hear. They had to be in the same house. They had to be together. This was their chance to be equals, to learn magic side by side, to—

"GRYFFINDOR!"

The word rang through the hall like a bell. Lily's face lit up with a radiant smile as she hurried to the Gryffindor table, where that Black boy was already making room for her. Severus felt something cold settle in his stomach, but he pushed it away. It didn't matter which house she was in. They would still be friends. They would still—

"Lupin, Remus!"

Another boy, this one looking rather shabby and tired, stepped forward. "GRYFFINDOR!" Of course.

"Pettigrew, Peter!"

A short, plump boy who looked like he might faint from nerves. The hat deliberated longer this time, but eventually: "GRYFFINDOR!"

"Potter, James!"

A boy with messy black hair and glasses bounded forward with infectious enthusiasm. He didn't even look nervous. The hat barely had time to settle before—"GRYFFINDOR!" The boy practically flew to the table, where Black grabbed him in a celebratory embrace as if they'd been friends for years, not minutes.

Severus's jaw tightened. The Gryffindor table was getting crowded with people who looked like they belonged in storybooks—heroes in training. And Lily was sitting there with them, laughing at something one of them said.

## His Turn

"Snape, Severus!"

The moment he'd been anticipating and dreading. Severus forced his feet to move, one in front of the other. The walk to the stool felt like miles. He could feel hundreds of eyes on him—his shabby coat, his lank hair, his too-large nose. He heard a snicker from somewhere behind him. His face burned, but he kept his expression carefully blank as he'd learned to do at home when his father was in one of his moods.

He sat on the stool, and Professor McGonagall lowered the hat onto his head. It fell over his eyes, blocking out the Great Hall, the watching students, everything. For a moment, there was only darkness and his own ragged breathing.

Then a voice spoke directly into his mind, dry and thoughtful: *"Ah, another difficult one. So much here, so much... pain, yes, but also ambition. Sharp mind, very sharp. Thirst for knowledge, hunger for recognition... and love, yes, deep and desperate love for that Muggle-born girl."*

Severus's breath caught. The hat could see everything—every hope, every fear, every secret wish he'd never spoken aloud.

*"You could be great in Gryffindor,"* the hat mused. *"Brave enough, in your own way. You walked away from your father's anger every day with your chin up. That takes a particular kind of courage."*

Gryffindor. He could be with Lily. They could—

*"But is that what you truly need?"* the hat interrupted his thoughts. *"Or is it what you want? There's a difference, you know. Gryffindor would throw you among lions who would see your differences before your potential. Among them, you would always be the outsider looking in, proving yourself, fighting to be seen as worthy."*

The hat paused, and Severus felt it delving deeper into his mind, sifting through memories—his mother teaching him his first spell in secret, the hours he'd spent in the library reading his mother's old textbooks, the satisfaction of finally mastering a difficult potion, the moment he'd created his first original spell modification at age ten.

*"Ah, there it is. SLYTHERIN!"*

The final word boomed through the Great Hall. Severus felt the hat being lifted from his head. The Slytherin table was applauding—not as enthusiastically as some of the other houses had cheered, but with a measured approval. He stood on shaky legs and walked to the table on the left, avoiding looking at the Gryffindor table. He didn't want to see Lily's reaction.

## A New Path

As Severus took his seat among the Slytherins, a tall boy with platinum blond hair extended a hand. "Lucius Malfoy, sixth year. Welcome to Slytherin, young Snape. That's quite a reputation you bring with you."

Severus blinked in confusion. "Reputation?"

Lucius's smile was knowing. "Word travels fast in our circles. They say you've been inventing spell modifications since before you even had a wand. That you know more about defensive magic than some fourth-years." He leaned in conspiratorially. "We value ambition and cunning here, yes, but we also value talent. And from what I hear, you have that in abundance."

Something in Severus's chest loosened slightly. He glanced down the table at the other Slytherins—some pure-bloods, yes, but he also noticed a few who looked as shabby as he did, whose robes weren't quite new, who carried themselves with the same careful dignity he'd cultivated.

"Thank you," Severus managed, surprised to find he meant it.

The sorting continued, but Severus barely heard the names. His mind was churning with everything the hat had said. *You would always be the outsider looking in.* Was the hat right? Would Gryffindor have been a mistake?

He finally allowed himself to glance at the Gryffindor table. Lily was watching him, and when their eyes met, she smiled—a genuine, warm smile—and gave him a little wave. Relief flooded through him. She didn't care what house he was in. They would still be friends.

But then James Potter leaned over and whispered something to Sirius Black, both of them glancing in Severus's direction. They didn't smile. They didn't wave. Their expressions were coolly assessing, marking him as different, as other, as rival.

Severus turned away, his jaw tight. The hat had been right. In Gryffindor, he would have spent every day proving himself to boys like that, fighting for scraps of recognition among the golden and the brave. Here, in Slytherin, perhaps he could simply be brilliant.

## The Feast Begins

Dumbledore stood, his long silver beard catching the candlelight. "Welcome," he said, his voice somehow reaching every corner of the Great Hall without seeming to shout, "welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!"

Food appeared on the tables—more food than Severus had ever seen in his life. Golden roasted chicken, mountains of mashed potatoes, platters of vegetables, jugs of pumpkin juice. The other first-years dove in eagerly, but Severus took a moment, overwhelmed by the abundance after years of sparse meals at Spinner's End.

"First time at a proper feast?" a girl across from him asked. She had dark hair and keen eyes. "I'm Charity Burbage. Muggle-born," she added, and there was a hint of defiance in her voice, as if daring anyone to object.

"Half-blood," Severus replied, serving himself a modest portion of potatoes. "Severus Snape."

"I know," Charity said. "I heard those Gryffindors talking about you already. Said you looked like you'd crawled out of a dungeon." Her expression turned sympathetic. "Idiots."

Severus felt an unexpected kinship with this girl who'd been sorted into Slytherin despite—or perhaps because of—her Muggle birth. "They don't matter," he said quietly.

"No," Charity agreed, "they don't. We'll show them what matters." She raised her goblet of pumpkin juice. "To Slytherin. To ambition. To proving them all wrong."

Severus clinked his goblet against hers. "To proving them wrong."

## The First Night

Later, after the feast, after the prefects had led them down to the dungeons, after he'd seen the common room with its greenish light filtering through the lake water, after he'd claimed a bed in the first-year boys' dormitory—after all of that, Severus lay awake in the darkness.

Through the window, he could see the murky green water of the lake, and occasionally a dark shape would swim past—the tentacle of the Giant Squid, perhaps, or a school of fish. The other boys in his dormitory were already snoring, exhausted by the excitement of the day.

Severus pulled out his wand—eleven inches, yew, dragon heartstring—and held it up in the dim light. His mother's last words to him before he'd boarded the train echoed in his mind: *"Be brave, Severus. Be brilliant. And remember, the house doesn't make the wizard—the wizard makes the house."*

He'd always assumed he'd be in Gryffindor with Lily. He'd never seriously considered Slytherin. But now that he was here, lying in this dungeon dormitory with its cold stone walls and ambitious occupants, he felt something he hadn't expected: potential.

The hat had seen it, Lucius Malfoy had acknowledged it, and even Charity Burbage had sensed it. Here, he wouldn't have to fight to be noticed. Here, being clever and ambitious and different wasn't a weakness—it was an asset.

Tomorrow, classes would begin. Tomorrow, he would start learning magic properly, not just from his mother's worn textbooks but from actual professors. Tomorrow, he would see Lily again, and they would prove that house rivalries didn't matter to true friends.

But tonight, Severus Snape lay in his new bed in the Slytherin dungeons and allowed himself to feel something he rarely felt: hope. Hope that perhaps the Sorting Hat had been right. Hope that perhaps he belonged here after all. Hope that perhaps, just perhaps, he could become the wizard he'd always dreamed of being.

The last thing he thought before sleep claimed him was of the stars he'd seen on the ceiling of the Great Hall—countless points of light in the darkness, each one burning bright and refusing to be diminished by the night.

Just like him.
